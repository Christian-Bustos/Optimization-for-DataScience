# Optimization for Data Science Course project and HW
## HW Topic:
Solve Multi-Class Logistic Regression Problems using:

-GD

-BCGD with randomized rule

-BCGD with GS rule
## Project Topic:
Optimization Methods for Clustering with implementations of the Frank-Wolfe algorithm, Pairwise Frank-Wolfe, and Away-Step Frank-Wolfe. The algorithms are tested on the ℓ2 and ℓ0 regularized max-clique problems using DIMACS datasets.
